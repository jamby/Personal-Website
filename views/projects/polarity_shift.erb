<p>This is a game I was a part of for my Structure of Game Production at Full Sail University. It was the first team project we did which involved four programmers (including myself). The class was a two month class, with 6 weeks for programming the game and the other 2 weeks devoted to making tools before we started development.</p>
<p>We wanted to make a game like the flash Portal game and decided to make it involving gravity. Our art was done by an artist at the school that did art for a lot of the groups during class.</p>
