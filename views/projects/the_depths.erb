<p>This is a game I was a part of for my Game Project at Full Sail University. Game Project lasted for about five months, three of which were devoted to developing the game. The first two months were for pre-production and design purposes. We had about 9 programmers, two artists and an internal producer.</p>
<p>We made the game a rail shooter because we all loved StarFox. It was a game that used an engine created by all of the groups in that class.</p>
