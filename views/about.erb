My name is Jared Hamby. I was born and raised in Fairfax, VA. I've always been a huge gamer and always wanted to make my own. During the Junior year of my High School career, the Art Institute of Washington came into my Network Administration class to show their students' works off. I was selected to play one of the games.
<p>Something clicked with me while playing that game. I realized that I wanted to program video games. I had heard about a school called Full Sail before and started to research it for the rest of the year. I had gone to the seminar and really liked what I saw.</p>
<p>I proceeded to go to Full Sail at the start of the next school year and enjoyed my time there fully. I learned a lot, quickly, which made programming fun.</p>
<p>I graduated Full Sail University in October of 2009 with a Bachelor of Science in Game Development. I started searching for jobs as a programmer but never had any luck getting into the industry. I applied to Bethesda Softworks nearby my home in Virginia and got a position as a Quality Assurance Tester, finally getting my foot into the door of the industry.</p>
<p>I'm still programming and learning new languages. As of now, my main language is C++, while also knowing C#, JavaScript, and Python. I am also learning more of Python along with ActionScript 3.0/Flash. While learning, I am also making games, mainly on the iPhone. It goes slow since I have a job, but I still am doing and still am loving it.</p>
<p>I would love to get a job as a programmer for a video game company to prove my worth. I promise I am worth it!</p>
